# random-datascience-projects

As a Data Scientist, I usually come across ideas that can be interesting to explore but not to spend weeks working on them. I am going to use this repository as a portfolio of such short weekends projects. The idea is that each project can be fitted into a jupyter notebook comprising all the steps of the analysis, from data collection to modelling and evaluation of performance.

The project that I have developed so far are:
* Nobel prize analytics: 
* S&P 500 CAMP:
* S&P 500 eigen-portfolios: portfolio optimization based on the construction of eigen-portfolios using PCA.
* S&P 500 t-SNE visualization:
* Modelling bank failures:
